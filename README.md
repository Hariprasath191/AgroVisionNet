# AgroVisionNet 🌿

An AI-powered web application for detecting plant diseases using deep learning. This application uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to classify plant diseases from images with high accuracy.

## Features

- 🎯 **Accurate Detection**: Uses deep learning models to identify 25 different plant diseases across multiple crops
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: User-friendly web interface for uploading and analyzing plant images
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- ⚡ **Fast Predictions**: Quick image analysis and results
- 📊 **Confidence Scores**: Provides confidence levels for each prediction

## Supported Plants and Diseases

The model can detect diseases in the following plants:
- **Apple**: Scab, Black rot, Cedar apple rust, Healthy
- **Corn (Maize)**: Cercospora leaf spot, Common rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy
- **Grape**: Black rot, Esca, Leaf blight, Healthy
- **Potato**: Early blight, Late blight, Healthy
- **Tomato**: Bacterial spot, Early blight, Late blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria leaf spot, Spider mites, Target Spot, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, Mosaic virus, Healthy

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hariprasath191/AgroVisionNet.git
cd AgroVisionNet
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Web Application

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. Upload a plant image and click "Analyze Plant" to get the disease detection results

### Training Your Own Model

If you have a plant disease dataset, you can train your own model:

```bash
python train_model.py --train-dir /path/to/training/data --epochs 10
```

Dataset structure should be:
```
training_data/
├── Apple___Apple_scab/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── Apple___Black_rot/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Command-Line Prediction

You can also make predictions from the command line:

```bash
python predict.py path/to/plant/image.jpg
```
